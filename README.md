## Data Engineer Introduction

You are now a Data Engineer, what is that?

### What do Data Engineers do?

From [Real Python](https://realpython.com/):

> Data engineering is a very broad discipline that comes with multiple titles. In many organizations, it may not even have a specific title. Because of this, it’s probably best to first identify the goals of data engineering and then discuss what kind of work brings about the desired outcomes.
>
>The ultimate goal of data engineering is to provide organized, consistent data flow to enable data-driven work, such as:
>
> - Training machine learning models
> - Doing exploratory data analysis
> - Populating fields in an application with outside data
>
>This data flow can be achieved in any number of ways, and the specific tool sets, techniques, and skills required will vary widely across teams, organizations, and desired outcomes. However, a common pattern is the **data pipeline**. This is a system that consists of independent programs that do various operations on incoming or collected data.

### Overlapping Roles

Data Engineers at Mashey are responsible for a broad range of engineerng practices, including aspects of the roles outlined below. During your onboarding process as a new Data Engineer at Mashey you will not be responsible for the overlapping roles, but it is beneficial to understand how the Data Engineer role will grow as you gain experience.

#### What do Analytics Engineers do?

It is important to understand where an Analytics Engineer fits between Data Engineers and Data Analysts. Saira Barles, Analytics Engineer at Hubspot describes the differences in this [blog post](https://dataform.co/blog/what-do-analytics-engineers-do) from [Dataform](https://dataform.co/):

> “Data engineers build the cupboard, they gather together the wood and the tools and put it together. The Analytics Engineers open the cupboard and start putting in the plates, mugs, bowls, and arrange them in a certain order. This could be arranging them into particular colours, shapes or sizes. Data analysts then go into the cupboard and they know where everything lives as it is arranged nicely. They can then grab the small blue mug they were looking for and go make a cup of tea!”

Understanding how to design and model data, similar to an Analytics Engineer, will be an extension to the role of Data Engineer at Mashey. It is a separate discipline and takes time to learn, but the ability to fulfill both roles will provide incredible value to our team.

#### What do DevOps Engineers do?

The role of a DevOps engineer will vary from one organization to another, but invariably entails some combination of release engineering, infrastructure provisioning and management, system administration, security, and DevOps advocacy. The Atlassian team has a great DevOps Engineer overview: [here](https://www.atlassian.com/devops/what-is-devops/devops-engineer).

> A DevOps engineer is an IT generalist who should have a wide-ranging knowledge of both development and operations, including coding, infrastructure management, system administration, and DevOps toolchains. DevOps engineers should also possess interpersonal skills since they work across company silos to create a more collaborative environment.
>
> DevOps engineers need to have a strong understanding of common system architecture, provisioning, and administration, but must also have experience with the traditional developer toolset and practices such as using source control, giving and receiving code reviews, writing unit tests, and familiarity with agile principles.

#### What do Cloud Engineers do?

There are generally 3 primary components of Cloud Engineering, which are outlined in this [Northeastern University blog post](https://www.northeastern.edu/graduate/blog/what-does-a-cloud-engineer-do/).

- Cloud Architecture
- Cloud Development
- Cloud Adminstration

> Cloud engineers must refine specific cloud computing skills in order to be successful in their roles. These skills range from software development and database administration to change management and data security.

At Mashey our Data Engineers live in the Cloud, and it's important to eventually be comfortable with fulfilling the above roles within our core Cloud technologies.
