### What do Data Engineers Do?

From [Real Python](https://realpython.com/):

> Data engineering is a very broad discipline that comes with multiple titles. In many organizations, it may not even have a specific title. Because of this, itâ€™s probably best to first identify the goals of data engineering and then discuss what kind of work brings about the desired outcomes.
>
>The ultimate goal of data engineering is to provide organized, consistent data flow to enable data-driven work, such as:
>
>- Training machine learning models
>- Doing exploratory data analysis
>- Populating fields in an application with outside data
>
>This data flow can be achieved in any number of ways, and the specific tool sets, techniques, and skills required will vary widely across teams, organizations, and desired outcomes. However, a common pattern is the **data pipeline**. This is a system that consists of independent programs that do various operations on incoming or collected data.
